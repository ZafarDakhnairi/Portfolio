# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, hobbies, and projects. It is built using HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

-   `css/`: Contains the main stylesheet (`style.css`) for the entire website.
-   `images/`: Stores all images used in the gallery and other pages.
-   `Home.html`: The home page of the portfolio.
-   `Hobbies.html`: A page detailing my personal hobbies.
-   `Skills.html`: A page listing my technical and language skills.
-   `Contact.html`: A page with my contact information.
-   `Gallery.html`: An image gallery page.

## Features

-   **Consistent Design:** All pages share a consistent look and feel using a single external stylesheet.
-   **Responsive Navigation:** The navigation menu allows for easy access to all sections of the site.
-   **Image Gallery:** A photo gallery is arranged using CSS floats.
-   **Clean Code:** The CSS is separated from the HTML, making the project easy to maintain.
